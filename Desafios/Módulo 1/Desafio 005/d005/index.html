    <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Isaque Lima</strong>, but many people call me by my nickname, Zack (my nephew loves to call me Zauro).
    I've been a student in the world of technology for about a year and a half, though my passion began much earlier. Since I was a child, I’ve always been fascinated by hardware learning how each component of a computer works has captivated me from a very young age.<br>
    Today, I’m focused on learning languages like HTML and CSS, and also diving into more complex programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, PHP, among others I intend to explore. I love watching series and playing games with Monique, she's a very important person in my life. However, before making any future plans together, I’ve committed myself to personal growth. I want to become a successful man, capable of providing an extraordinary life for her, my future family, my siblings, and my mother who will always be my foundation. I’m deeply grateful for all the values and lessons they’ve given me.<br>
    My dream is to become a successful entrepreneur, founder of a future tech company not only focused on providing outsourced services to major global corporations, but also on creating meaningful projects and nonprofit organizations. I aim to inspire and empower young people and children to enter the tech industry and become leaders in their fields. I want to collaborate with people around the world to create a more digital yet secure world, using technology to fight hunger, support the healthcare sector, contribute to leading hospitals, and even make an impact in areas like fashion and sports.<br>
    I envision the future ZCK helping to make the world a better place.</P>
